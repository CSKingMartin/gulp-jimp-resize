# gulp-jimp2
Maniuplate images' size with few dependencies. Uses JIMP wrapped with gulp.

Inspired by the same functionality as gulp-jimp, which has open issues crucial to it's functionality. JIMP is a great, simple image processing library with 0 dependencies. This gulp plugin wraps JIMP functionality for gulp in an extremely simple way purely for resizing images ONLY. Resizes based on: width or height (or both), and can crop to a square image.
